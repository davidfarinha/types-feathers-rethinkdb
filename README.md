# types/feathers-rethinkdb

### Description

Types for the [feathers-rethinkdb](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-rethinkdb) package.
Built ontop of the following core rethinkdb/rethinkdbdash types:

* [types/rethinkdb](https://github.com/types/rethinkdb) -
  * The original version of the definition comes from [@niieani](https://github.com/niieani/rethinkdb-typescript-definition).
  * Very thorough rethinkdb typings. These appear to be the best typings available at the moment for rethinkdb (as opposed to the rethinkdb typings on DefinitelyTyped which as of now [are not yet fully complete](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/rethinkdb/index.d.ts#L13)).
* [types/rethinkdbdash](https://github.com/types/rethinkdbdash)
